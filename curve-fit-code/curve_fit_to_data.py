"""
curve_fit_to_data.py
    A simple example using scipy curve_fit to fit data from a file.

    Requires scipy 0.8.

    The example provided is a fit of Gaussian or Lorentzian functions
    to a data file gauss.txt.

    To fit your own data, you need to change:
    (1) def func(x,*p) to return the function you are trying to fit,
    (2) the name of the data file read in by numpy.loadtxt,
    (3) the initial p0 values in the scipy.optimize.curve_fit call.

    Don't assume the software is intelligent and produce a sensible
    result not matter what. For example, your initial guess
    for the parameters does matter. (e.g. Try changing the default guess
    for the central value in this example from 1171 to 1170 and
    see what happens.)
