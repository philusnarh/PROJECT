The study used intensity mapping technique to observe the combined radio emissions of CO and HI emanating from a diffuse source. Antenna elements with short separations like
KAT-7 (not in operation now) and SKA1-mid can be used for such observation. Despite the potential of this technique, it is subject to exact foreground reduction of continuum signal
from the Milky Way galaxy and other radio sources beyond. In addition, the signal is dominated by direction-dependent effects and the primary beam being the most serious effect,
since it controls the full intensity of the measured signal. Furthermore, the inaccuracies in the receivers, cause part of the foreground to seep into the absolute intensity, making
it difficult to observe the CO or HI signal. For the current on-going SKA instruments and future aperture arrays, these will be affected by antenna pointing errors and polarization
leakages. To address these problems, first, we create a dense set of dipole positions with a complete secondary blockage to mimic the illumination pattern of KAT-7-like dish. Second,
we use Zernike model to reconstruct MeerKAT L-band beams and then third, we try to simulate EM beams of SKA1-mid as an optical telescope. Next we perturb these beams by introducing
realistic errors in them. We then simulate these beams (true and corrupted) with the foreground to estimate for the CO and HI signal. At the end, our simulation shows that,
if we consider a correct model of the primary beam, then the intrinsic partial leakage of linear polarization ($|Q + iU|_{T} \longrightarrow I$) is given at $\approx 1.0 \%$. 
Furthermore, when we correct for the beam errors in Stokes $I$ then, it is possible to evaluate the angular spectrum of both CO and HI  at a multipole moment of $l \lesssim 50$, 
however, this is vice versa if we do calibrate for the beam erros. Finally, the study shows that, Zernike and convolution techniques are good models for intensity mapping experiments.

 The completion of this research is made up of immense inputs from many people to whom I owe a debt of gratitude. 
First and foremost, I thank my supervisors: Prof. Oleg M. Smirnov who doubles as the 
SKA Chair in Radio Astronomy Techniques and Technologies (RATT), which is hosted by Rhodes University 
and my main supervisor, particularly, for the strong affection he puts in everything he does and for his enormous understanding 
in Computational Mathematics and Radio Interferometry, Prof. Filipe B. Abdalla, for his expertise in Cosmology and Intensity Mapping Experiments and for the
patience he had in supporting me especially during the first year of the research. Also, Dr. Khan M. B. Asad for his understanding in Intensity Mapping Experiments.
I also show my appreciation to everyone who directly took part in the realisation of this work, particularly 
to Dr. Richard Shaw for helping me out with the foreground simulations and Dr. Jamie Leech for teaching me how to use the {\tt GRASP} software.
% I acknowledge many individuals, who even if in a less technical way, have been and are of vital importance for me throughout this research experience.
My course mates deserve the best recognition. Sphe, Marcel, Ridhima, Liju, Kela, Alex and the others 
have been wonderful companions throughout the study period. I would like to thank my family, Mr. Francis D. Narh (father),
Mrs. Salome Nortey (mother), Samuel Annor Narh (brother), Esther Amatsu Narh, Christiana Koryoonmaatso Narh (sisters), Patricia Opoku (wife), Adelaide and Salome (daughters) 
for their love and trust. Lastly, I am very grateful to the SKA and NRF for supporting this research.
% Without them this accomplishment would have been unachievable.
